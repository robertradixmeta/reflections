When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to create a remote repository to share code with other developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might want to pull changes manually instead of automatically so you have control
over the baseline that your code is being written against.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

In GitHub, a fork is an action that clones a repository. A clone is a copy of a repository
in GitHub or a local repository. A branch is created from the master branch in a 
repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Having the last known state of the remote stored locally allows for the developer to
make changes without being connected to GitHub.
